Practices has traditionally taken place at North Star: Self Directed Learning for Teens in the Fall, and then the Shutesbury Elementary School in the Spring. We welcome all dancers, regardless of experience level, from grade 7 and up. If you're interested in joining the team, please, send us an email! We accept new dancers starting in September.
