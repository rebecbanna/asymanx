Many of ASY's dances are not the traditional Cotswold dances people are familiar with seeing. We do several Manx dances, a style of dance from the Isle of Mann. As far as we know, we are the only people in North America doing these dances (Are you another Manx dancer in North America? We'd love to get in touch! Contact us here)
