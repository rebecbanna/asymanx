Many of ASY's dances are not the traditional Cotswold dances people are familiar with seeing. We do several Manx dances, a style of dance from the Isle of Mann. As far as we know, we are the only people in North America doing these dances (Are you another Manx dancer in North America? We'd love to get in touch! See our contact info on the home page).

This is a video of us performing a Manx jig called Gorse Sticks at the Marlboro Ale in 2011
